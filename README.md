## 🧠 What is GridMind-CT?

**GridMind-CT** is a novel AI system designed to apply **transformer-based causal reasoning** to the **Indian power grid**. It aims to support grid operators, researchers, and planners with:

- 🧩 **Causal analysis** of grid disturbances  
- ⚡ **Real-time decision suggestions** for control actions  
- 📉 **Simulation-integrated forecasting** and counterfactual reasoning  
- 🧠 **Explainable transformer-based architecture** trained on power system data

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Causal Transformer**: Learns cause-effect relationships from PMU/SCADA logs and events.
- **Multi-Modal Input**: Supports numerical signals, text logs, and grid topology.
- **Power System Simulation**: Integrated with `pandapower` for realistic fault and recovery modeling.
- **Counterfactual Reasoning**: Simulates what would have happened with alternative actions.
- **Explainable Outputs**: Visualizes attention maps and generates human-readable recommendations.
